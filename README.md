# AngularJs UI-Router Example for D2642

This is an example application for routing for the AngularJs lecture.

## Get started
You will need [Node.js][1c52267b] and [Node Package Manager (npm)][7e4ab2ea].

  [1c52267b]: https://www.nodejs.com/ "Node.js"
  [7e4ab2ea]: https://www.npmjs.com/ "Node Package Manager"

When those are installed, install the [http-server][fd8d4fca] package:  
`npm install http-server -g`

  [fd8d4fca]: https://github.com/indexzero/http-server "http-server"

To start the application, run:  
`http-server -c-1`  
_-c-1 means disable cache_

Then go to:  
`http://localhost:8080`

Viola!
